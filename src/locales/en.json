Currently, only names 13 characters and above can be claimed through the Superhero wallet. This will be improved later. {br}{br} You can claim as many names on Superhero as you want.

You can also send to someone else’s wallet by pasting their wallet address into the wallet address field. {br} - Enter the amount you want to withdraw. {br} Click Review to check your transaction details. {br} - Hit Send to confirm the withdrawal. {br}Tips can then be converted into other cryptocurrencies or fiat and transferred to your local bank. {br} Processes for exchanges vary per country.

Simple as that. {br} IMPORTANT: You’ll need this seed phrase to retrieve your wallet in case you lose access to the extension for any reason (migrating to a new device, reinstalling browser, etc.)."
