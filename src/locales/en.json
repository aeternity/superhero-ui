Launching a token in this way entails a bonding curve smart contract. Once this contract is launched, users can buy or sell into the curve. Buying pushes the token price up along the curve, while selling pushes the token price down along the curve."

Users that have bought any amount of the token can then vote on the payout spread to be paid out to the creator of the smart contract, . If  the creator has earned the communities trust, they can then vote on, essentially, releasing a portion of the tokens to be used by the creator of the smart contract."
