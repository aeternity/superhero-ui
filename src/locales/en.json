Currently, only names 13 characters and above can be claimed through the Superhero wallet. This will be improved later. {br}{br} You can claim as many names on Superhero as you want.

For long-term storage of large amounts of AE, we recommend using a cold wallet, like AirGap. {br} To withdraw tips you've collected, you can send tips from your SUPERHERO wallet to your AE wallet address in a crypto exchange that supports AE tokens. {br} - To withdraw, go to the hamburger menu. {br} - Click Withdraw. {br} - Enter your wallet address from the crypto exchange of your choice. You can also send to someone else’s wallet by pasting their wallet address into the wallet address field. {br} - Enter the amount you want to withdraw. {br} Click Review to check your transaction details. {br} - Hit Send to confirm the withdrawal. {br}Tips can then be converted into other cryptocurrencies or fiat and transferred to your local bank. {br} Processes for exchanges vary per country. In many cases, there will be a few minutes’ wait time or longer depending on the exchange’s capacity and processes.

The task of keeping the keys to your wallet is yours and yours alone, Superhero. {br} Here’s how to secure and backup your wallet: {br} Once you’re in your dashboard, you’ll get a series of words called a seed phrase. The seed phrase is somewhat like a password – it’s a unique set of words (in order) which connects you to your wallet. {br} - Click the hamburger menu on the upper right of your wallet. {br} - Go to Settings, chose Security. {br} - On the next screen, click Show seed phrase. {br} - Write down the 12 words displayed on a piece of paper and keep it in a safe and secret place. Simple as that. {br} IMPORTANT: You’ll need this seed phrase to retrieve your wallet in case you lose access to the extension for any reason (migrating to a new device, reinstalling browser, etc.)."
